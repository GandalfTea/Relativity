# From Special to General Relativity
## Equivalence Principle:
Einstein was hypothosising how someone freefalling  (in a closed enviroment like a lift) would observe it's surroundings compared to someone observing from the outside. He compared it to the idea to that of Special Relativity, with the freefalling observer in a lift replacing that in the train.

Einstien believed that the simularities between the effects in Special Relativity and this thought experiment must be a _"Fundimental property of Gravity"_ - laying down the foundation of the Equivalence Principle which is the cornerstone to the theory of General Relativity.

This Equivalence Principle states that someone freefalling with their closed enviroment cannot know that they are free-falling, and that any experiment inside the closed enviroment has exactly the same results as someone at rest or moving uniformally in deep space.

## Gravity and Acceleation
Just as effects of gravity can be negated from a free-fall acceleration downwards, a psudeo-gravity can be imposed by accelerating upwards.

This means that an observer doing an experiment of dropping a ball to the ground wont be able to tell if they are on the surface of a plannet of gravity g, or in a rocket mopving upwards with an acceleration of g.

With the accelerating reference frame with the observer, fictitious forces are introduced (forces which appear to act from nowhere due to movement of the reference frame - like a car accelerating throughing everyone in the back of the seats).

Einstein decided that the force experienced from gravity is just like these fictitious forces. The apparent magnitude of which is proportional to the mass of the object experiencing the force, just as the force experienced from the driver from the car seat as they accelerate is the amount needed to keep the driver accelerating at the same rate as the car. This way of thinking still supports that which was thought up in _Newton's Laws of Gravitation_ with an object in a gravitational field experiencing a force proportional to its mass.

## Physical Consequences
Just as acceleration causes light to redshift, Einstein proposed that the same must be true with the gravitational field. This is known as gravitational frequency shift.

This gravitational frequency shift also corrisponds to gravitaional time dialation. This is different observers messure different frequencies of the same light waves, meaning time is moving differently for both of them - with the observer higher in the gravitational field experincing time faster.

Simular logic also explains the gravitational deflection of light where, within a gravitational field, light is deflected "downwards", however a more complete function of General Relativity is needed to calculate the effects accurately. 
## Tidal Effects
The Equivilence Principle fails to explain from the perspective of a free falling object, why a person, elsewhere on the body, is feeling a force.

An easy way to imagine this situation is with two bodies falling towards the earth, with the reference frame falling along-side the objects.

![Two bodies falling towards the center of the Earth accelerate towards each other as they fall.

These objects will seem to just float weightlessly in space, except the fact that they are not falling straight down on a straight line endpoint, but rather both falling towards a single point in space, that being the body's centre of mass. This means, from the reference point of the reference frame, the bodies objects will appear to be slowly moving towards one-another.

This is what the Tidal Effect is - name sake being that it causes tides but I have been unable to see that as of yet.

This effect though is why the previous Equivalence Principle cannot be used, and a new theory is needed to describe how matter effects the inertial environment around it.
## From acceleration to geometry
After exploring the Equivalence Principle and the role of tidal forces, Einstein discovered sveral analogies to do with the geometry of surfaces.
An example of this is the translation from an inertial reference frame to a rotating reference frame, which is analogous to the transition from a Cartesian coordinate system into a curved one (I guess we will see how later).

As I stated to Octavian, the presence or absence of Tidal Forces can mean that the observer free-falling in a lift can determine whether or not they are under the influence of gravity. This is simular to how the presence or absence of curviture determins if a surface is equivilent to a plane (Kinda obvious but worth noting).

This parralell is what caused Einstein to search for a geometric formulation of gravity (in the summer of '69.. i mean '19)

### 4.3 Spacetime
The main reason for introducing the concept of spacetime was to remove the problems caused by having different things happening depending on the observer.

When thinking of normal Relativity and the Lorentz, the dialated coordinates - t', x', y', z' are dependent on the characteristics of the observer and therefore don't have significance since
