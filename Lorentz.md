## Lorentz Transform

Below are the Lorentz Transforms for time and space, and the Lorentz Factor:

The Lorentz Factor can be thought of as a scaling factor of how things change when something is traveling at a very high velocities from a stationary frame of reference.

The normal time dialation equation from special relativity only has t' on the top - basically:
t = t' Î³
